Programs in the field of music, theatre and dance have occupied most of the time and energy of the staff and faculty of the Institute since its inception in 1962. Hidden Valley was begun in Southern California, and named for its first site in the Angeles National Forest. The first several years of its existence, the staff concentrated on the high school Summer Music Seminars. The programs eventually outgrew the original location, and in 1967 moved its operations from Southern California to the Monterey Peninsula. For two years, the summer programs were held on the campus of the Robert Louis Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, and for three years, they were conducted on the campus of the York School in Monterey. Meanwhile, the administration continued its intensive search for a permanent home. Finally, in 1972, Hidden Valley moved to its present location in Carmel Valley: a rustic, 10-acre site nestled in the foothills of the Santa Lucias.

In an effort to broaden the scope of its program, Hidden Valley began exploring the area of theatre, first with a children's theatre group, then with a series of musicals presented at the Sunset Center in 1972 and 1973. These explorations, coupled with a desire on the part of the administration to develop Hidden Valley into a year-round Institute of the Arts, eventually led to the establishment of the Opera Ensemble in 1974. Since that time, the Opera program has grown tremendously, becoming one of the most widely-respected training ensembles in the country.","CA",3,,"yes","yes",,"Dance","Tap","Ballet","Drama/Theater",,,,,,70,"per session","pdf","https://www.facebook.com/HiddenValleyMusicSeminars","yes","http://www.hiddenvalleymusic.org/webart/xlogo.png.pagespeed.ic.b1ksND55Xn.webp","http://www.hiddenvalleymusic.org/webart/customtext/36a.jpg",

In doing so, Ovation has become a safe haven for many youth in our community.  We attract students of all levels of ability, from the professional child actor to the extremely shy teenager that just wants to try something new.  The students are free to explore their creativity without fear of judgment or rejection.  As a result, the students who go through the program have discovered more  than a gift in the arts; they have discovered security and confidence in themselves as individuals.  

The goal for Ovation has always been to teach more than mere  classes in the Arts.  We develop confidence by teaching life skills such as self-discipline, teamwork and most importantly the concept of “paying it forward” by giving back to their community whether it’s singing to seniors at a convalescent home or handing out toys to children at Christmas.  In doing this, we change the world one student at a time.

Ovation currently meets twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 4:00 to 7:00 PM.  We have 3 groups of classes – Kids (ages 5-8), Tweens (ages 9-12), and Teens (ages 13-18.)

The classes are designed to teach them coordination, posture, social ease, and rhythm while exploring the world of ballroom and latin dancing. Whether your child is interested in doing high level performances or if they just want to learn to dance in a fun environment – we’ve got a class that will fit your child’s needs.
Parents have chosen Youth Jam for their kids for a variety of reasons – here are the most popular ones:
> Your child loves dancing but not leotards: Kids can learn to dance in comfortable clothing in an even more comfortable and fun environment. If ballet isn’t “their thing”, maybe ballroom is?
> This is Timeless: Partner dancing is a skill that doesn’t go out of style. Getting them involved early makes an impact on their social future.
> Change the Routine: Want to give them an activity that is both athletic and artistic? Nothing changes up the routine like learning the Tango, Salsa, or Swing. Boredom sets in when things get predictable, so try something new and exciting this summer.
Here are some examples of the dances we teach:
 > Foxtrot - Imagine a wedding reception and your son or daughter dancing and carrying on a conversation at the same time. Skillfully navigating around the room. Foxtrot is social dancing at its finest.
> Tango – The dance of drama! The Tango teaches dancers young and old to move with confidence and sophistication.
> Salsa – One of the most popular dances in the world right now, the salsa combines fast movement with exciting music.
> Samba – You’ve seen it on TV and now your kids get to try out the national dance of Brazil! Want your kids to develop coordination and get a great workout at the same time? This is the dance.
Before long, your kids will recognize the dances that they see on TV and may even teach you a step or two. What it all boils down to is that learning how to ballroom dance is different, and therefore, keeps them engaged.
