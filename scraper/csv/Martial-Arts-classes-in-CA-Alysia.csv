Basketball, soccer, and baseball are all great activities for children, but Juarez's Martial Arts is personal development through a physical discipline. Our exciting, yet disciplined classes focus a child's attention, thus improving his or her ability to learn. Learning builds a sense of accomplishment. With each new accomplishment a student's self-confidence grows, and confidence is the first step in the empowerment of a young person's physical and mental abilities.

Once we begin to develop a student's self confidence, we are then able to install the values of respect, courtesy, honesty, perseverance, and integrity that are the foundation of martial arts, dating back thousands of years. Your child will develop perseverance, which is a non-quitting spirit to overcome life's obstacles. Instilling a non-quitting spirit helps a child overcome challenges, to succeed in the face of adversity, and to be a goal setter and a goal getter!","CA",4,99,"yes","no","no","Martial Arts",,,,,,"web form, phone","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Juarezs-Martial-Arts/1416940195236485?sk=photos_stream","no","http://montereykarate.com/uploads/3/3/8/2/3382488/7466378_orig.jpg","https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10007396_1416941825236322_4483914497990366866_n.jpg?oh=2ce036a6a6c8cb77fc0efdb022eda329&oe=54F13117"

these early Thai soldiers also became famous for their toughness in 
close-quarters weaponless combat, where legs, knees, elbows and hands 
took the place of swords and sticks. This type of weaponless fighting 
became Muay Thai, known as the ï¿½Science of Eight Limbs. ï¿½Though the Thai army still uses its lethal techniques, Muay Thai has also been the countryï¿½s most popular spectator sport for hundreds of years. There

“rocks, paper, and scissors”, in that if someone large is coming

1st Step:  We believe in “Power Under Control”.   The more powerful a 
martial artist, the more important it is to find balance by embodying 
great character traits.  The first step in the martial arts journey is 
to gain control of oneself.
2nd Step:  Skill development starts with
respectful, attentive, and determined teachers and students.  Skill 
development grows into the ability to apply athletic attributes to the 
learned techniques.  
3rd Step:  Once the techniques become 
instinctive, the martial arts journey re-born again through teaching 
others and giving back to the art.  A martial arts leader is born.  
During this step, and through developing others, a student becomes a

In the mid 80's, the  Bernal Heights neighborhood was known to have an above average crime  rate, which included random assaults, robberies, and the selling of  illegal drugs. It made walking the streets unsafe during any time of the day. Although, this was considered a rough neighborhood it was Professor  Lama's vision to share his knowledge in self-defense  so that others may benefit.Professor Lama first began teaching out of his  own garage where he only had five students.  The space was very limited, but Professor managed to teach katas and conduct sparring sessions in his 12'x18' garage space. His motivation and  combined passion for teaching encouraged him to open up his first formal  karate studio in Bernal Heights. After  four successful years in  business, Lama's Kenpo Karate expanded and moved into a larger location  in Bernal Heights. As enrollment increased at Lama's Kenpo Karate, Sibok Lama moved the school to its present day location in San Bruno, Ca. It is here that Professor continues  to build self-confidence, awareness, and discipline into his students.","CA",3,99,"yes",,,"Martial Arts",,,,99,"per_month","phone, email","https://www.facebook.com/LamasKenpo/timeline","no","https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/426031_10150649183229781_818625972_n.jpg?oh=0ddc76541af8cd6101dd3179cc3e567d&oe=54DDB039","https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/459388_10150776544979781_1671963216_o.jpg"
