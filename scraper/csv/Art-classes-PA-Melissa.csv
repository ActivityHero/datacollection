Leading educators recognize Monart as a way students can use several learning styles by teaching them how to focus and concentrate, make decisions, solve problems, plan, sequence and develop hand-eye coordination.  Just like a student learns to perceive what they wnat to draw in terms of basic elements of shape, and to develop the skills they need to translate that information on to paper.  Since 1979, Monart has been taught around the world.  The Monart method has achieved astounding results with children and adults without previous training or ""talent.""  A desire to learn to draw is all that is required.

  Each week the lesson is planned by the instructor on a particular theme, giving enough structure to insure success, and enough freedom for independent creativity.  In a non-competitive, peaceful environment students are taught that there is no wrong way to draw.  The curriculum is balanced and includes a wide range of subjects and media.

What began as one person, working with children in her home, has developed into an international business that teaches drawing to thousands of students every week.

Fetter applied her fine arts education and background in child development to create an original, step-by-step method to teach children drawing, the fundamental skill of all visual arts.

Research and education experts say what Young Rembrandts has always delivered: there is a significant correlation between involvement in the arts and achievement in the classroom. Children who learn to draw using the Young Rembrandts method develop spatial reasoning and fine motor skills, order and sequencing abilities, visualization, and self-discipline as well as fundamental art skills. Our original curriculum introduces concrete ideas and techniques that enlarge their visual vocabularies, enrich their imaginations and their minds.

Today, Young Rembrandts partners with pre-schools, elementary schools and community centers to either augment or supply their art education programs.
