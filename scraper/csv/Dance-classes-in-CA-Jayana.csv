The Healy School became involved in all the Irish activities in the San Francisco area and represented Ireland at the 1936 World Fair on Treasure Island. Ann helped her father with classes and eventually took over the school.  

 

Ann continues to teach beginner level dancers, but now shares the responsibility of running the school with her daughter Patti Ann and her granddaughters Christina and Alisa. Between the 3 generations, they offer dance lessons seven days a week and have expanded their school beyond San Francisco to Marin and Sonoma counties.

 

The Healy Irish Dance Studio gained recognition internationally for team dancing in 2004 with the Senior Ladies Ceili placing 14th at the World Championships in Belfast, Ireland, ranking them 2nd in the United States. In 2006, the Junior Girls Ceili placed 5th at the World Championships in Belfast, ranking them the top North American team. Throughout the years, several Healy soloists have recalled at the World Championships, including John O'Malley who was the first dancer from the Western Region to ever recall at the World Championships.

Our mission is to bring together a group of technically superior, passionate, positive, highly skilled, experienced teachers to guide our members through a meaningful and well-rounded dance education. We focus on creating and building upon a solid foundation of technique in each dance style. We promote and foster the growth of each dancer on an individual level. We work to bring to life the language of dance in a way that teaches our students about what it means to be effective communicators, reliable and dependable team players, confident and flexible individuals, devoted and well structured members, open minded and creative artists, critical thinkers, rhythmic and spatially aware movers, healthy and physically strong athletes, self reflective and respectful people, graceful and powerful members of our community. 

For us, at The Pretenders Studio, it is this powerful and essential combination of art, sport, physical and emotional nonverbal communication that brings out the best in our dancers and brings about positive change in our community. We teach our dancers to listen for and find the heartbeat of the music and connect it to their own heartbeat. We encourage students to stretch outside of their comfort zones to find expressive quality of movement and to search within themselves to find the strength, power, confidence, and individuality to share with their classmates and ultimately with an audience. 

We expect members to approach their art with open heartedness, support, love and full commitment. We expect members to be honest and to have fun! We enforce the notion that dance is not about attaining perfection but rather about investing in the process and therefore, our measure of success is in witnessing how far we have come and how much progress we have made both individually and collectively. Holding members, teachers, and families of The Pretenders Studio accountable to these core values is what makes it possible for us to grow, improve, dance to our greatest potential, and “Dance For A Difference”.","CA",6,18,"Y","Y","N","Dance","Ballet","Jazz","Bollywood","HipHop","Ballroom",,,,325,"per_session","not online",,,,"http://www.thepretendersstudio.com/FAQ_files/shapeimage_3.png",,,,
